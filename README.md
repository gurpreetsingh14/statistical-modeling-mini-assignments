# Statistical Modelling Mini-Assignments
For the course STATISTICAL MODELLING I prepared few assignments to learn following concepts:
1. Linear Regression - Analysis of Residuals, Global Effect test, Interaction, Multicollinearity
2. Logistic Regression
3. Longitudinal & Correlated Data - Covariance structure, Group Effect, Random Effect, Random Slope model and Prediction

To cover the above mentioned topics I have created two assignments. All the code part related to the assignments is present in .sas code file.

## Assignment 1: Interpretation of Student Class Performance
